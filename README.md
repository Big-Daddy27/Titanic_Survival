# Titanic_Survival
Developed a Titanic survival prediction model using Logistic Regression to analyze passenger data and predict survival probabilities.
Utilized Python and its popular libraries namely Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn to preprocess data, train the
model and evaluate its performance.
Conducted exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain insights into passenger demographics.
Implemented feature engineering techniques such as handling null values, encoding categorical variables and scaling
numerial features to enhance model accuracy.
Obtained an accuracy score of 81% for the training dataset and 79% for the testing dataset. Generated a confusion
matrix to assess the modelâ€™s performance, visualising the results using a heatmap for intuitive interpretation
